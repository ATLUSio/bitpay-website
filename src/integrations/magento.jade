        p.lead <strong>Very Important:</strong> You must complete remove any previous versions of the Bitpay Magento plugin before installing this new updated version.
        p The plugin has been completely re-written to work with BitPay's new cryptographically secure RESTful API and will conflict with any previous plugin versions which use the old API. To help you remove the old plugin files from your system, we have created a convenient shell script for Unix/Linux/Mac OS systems which will scan your webserver for these older files and delete them. You may also remove these files by hand of course and the complete list of the files can be found in the source of the script for your convenience. You can download this delete script <a href="https://github.com/bitpay/magento-plugin/blob/master/scripts/delete.sh">from Github</a>.
        p To use this script, simply download to your server and execute the script from a shell. You may have to mark the script executable before first use.

        .note 
          p Pairing Codes are only valid for a short period of time. If it expires before you get to use it, you can always create a new one an use the new one.
          p You will only need to do this once since each time you do this, the extension will generate public and private keys that are used to identify you when using the API.
        p You are also able to configure how BitPay's IPN (Instant Payment Notifications) changes the order in your Magento store.

        p As a merchant, the orders in your Magento store can be treated as any other order. You may need to adjust the Invoice Settings depending on your order fulfillment.
