  h3 Accepting a Bitcoin Payment
  p With bitcoin, there's no sensitive customer information to collect and store, and there are no cards to charge. Customers simply send bitcoin from their computer or mobile device directly to a bitcoin payment address.

  p Once received, BitPay converts the bitcoin to your preferred currency and adds the full amount of the payment – without fees – to your next BitPay account <a href="/docs/settlement">settlement</a>. Funds are then deposited to your bank account or bitcoin address.

  p You can accept bitcoin in a variety of ways. Choose a method below to get started.
