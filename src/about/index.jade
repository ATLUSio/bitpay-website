        p.lead At the time of our founding in 2011, Bitcoin was still in its infancy. Even while much of its promise was still hypothetical, we saw that it could enable secure, global commerce for the first time in history. BitPay was our way of making that vision a reality.  
        p We were the first to give Bitcoin's early adopters access to this innovation in payments, and we have grown in step with Bitcoin itself. BitPay now provides payment processing to more than 50,000 businesses on six continents. We have introduced bitcoin to many of the world's leading ecommerce platforms, and we have used this technology to solve some of the fundamental problems of the merchant experience.
        p Even with our success, we are far from finished with the vision that brought us here. From eliminating processing fees to prioritizing open source software, we are continuing to find new ways to pioneer the future of payments.
